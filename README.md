# Mock Dashboard - IPA Decision Tool on PowerBI

This project is a mock dashboard that can be used as a decision-making tool to determine which IPA (Independent Physicians Association) to prioritize the most contracting efforts into. It is mainly to showcase my capabilities in PowerBI, and how my data visualization skills can be useful to a potential employer. Data within is generated by me.

## Background

In the United States, private health insurance companies often partner with local medical groups and IPAs to provide thorough coverage to members of the local community. However, when a patient requires care from specialists that are outside of their IPAs' local network, they often become subject to financial burden because their insurance will not pay for their needed services. Additionally, healthcare providers who service these patients potentially do not get reimbursed, resulting in loss of revenue.

This dashboard highlights 4 potential local IPAs in central California. A hypothetical healthcare provider that mainly provides two different types of therapies is used here. Metrics such as new patient referrals received and which of them require authorizations can be helpful in analyzing and justifying which IPA to initially contract with so that their scope of business can expand, and potentially prevent further loss of revenue.
