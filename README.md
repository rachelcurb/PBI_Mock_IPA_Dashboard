# Mock Dashboard - IPA Decision Tool on PowerBI

This project is a mock dashboard that can be used as a decision-making tool to determine which IPA (Independent Physicians Association) to prioritize the most contracting efforts into. It is mainly to showcase my capabilities in PowerBI, and how my data visualization skills can be useful to a potential employer. Data within is generated by me.

## Background

In the United States, private health insurance companies often partner with local medical groups and IPAs to provide thorough coverage to members of the local community. However, when a patient requires care from specialists that are outside of their IPAs' local network, they often become subject to financial burden because their insurance will not pay for their needed services. Additionally, healthcare providers who service these patients potentially do not get reimbursed, resulting in loss of revenue.

This dashboard highlights 4 potential local IPAs in central California. A hypothetical healthcare provider that mainly provides two different types of therapies is used here. Metrics such as new patient referrals received and which of them require authorizations can be helpful in analyzing and justifying which IPA to initially contract with so that their scope of business can expand, and potentially prevent further loss of revenue.

## Dashboard Design

### Features
* Users can interact with and leverage the dashboard to:
  * Obtain an overview of KPIs for patients whose insurances are affiliated with IPAs
  * Assess which IPA is preventing the most patients from receiving services through authorization denials
  * Determine the most common reasons as to why care was not provided
  * Explore geographical and temporal trends for each IPA and as compared to each other

  * Users are provided an overview of the metrics highlighted within the decision tool. It includes all 4 IPAs, the number of cancellations, how many patient referrals required authorizations, and more. Users can also leverage the home page to toggle by therapy (as depicted by A or B).
* The buttons on the left of the page showcare data from each individual IPA (depicted by Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta)

  
***Alpha IPA Page:***
_(Descriptions below apply to all other pages that depict each IPA)_
 * Users are shown data from patients who insurances are exclusively affiliated with Alpha IPA
 * It depicts average number of authorization approvals, which can be a significant metric to present to stakeholders who seek to know a significant factor in why patients are not being provided services
 * It also depicts a line chart that compares how many patients were referred for therapy and how many ultimately received services

## Conclusions
This mock dashboard can be used as a tool to present to stakeholders to justify which IPA to pool efforts into. The metrics included are some of the most common factors that healthcare providers consider when trying to analyze and pinpoint opportunities in which more patients can be serviced and to also find where revenue can be further produced. It would be up to the discretion of the healthcare company using this tool to determine which metrics are the most important.
